## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 0.6h | 3.2h | 8.1h | 119.9h |
| AI worker hours | 1.6h | 9.9h | 43.9h | 266.6h |
| AI concurrency hours | 2.5h | 16.0h | 60.5h | 523.1h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 15 | 31 | 301 |
| Worker sessions | 20 | 127 | 112 | 2,295 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 108 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_400.3M total tokens processed. 88.7% cache hit rate._

_$2,867.11 total saved ($2,068.73 caching + $798.38 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~88.7% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
