## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 0.0h | 5.8h | 14.0h | 14.0h |
| AI worker hours | 1.1h | 6.3h | 15.0h | 15.0h |
| AI concurrency hours | 1.1h | 14.5h | 37.9h | 37.9h |
| Interactive sessions | 1 | 4 | 18 | 18 |
| Worker sessions | 5 | 72 | 216 | 216 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours measured from AI message timestamps (reading, thinking, typing between responses)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_851.3M total tokens processed. 92.6% cache hit rate._

_$8,898.23 total saved ($8,255.85 caching + $642.38 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~92.6% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
