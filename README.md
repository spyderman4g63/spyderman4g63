## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 0.0h | 0.6h | 8.1h | 115.5h |
| AI worker hours | 1.5h | 9.6h | 35.8h | 241.4h |
| AI concurrency hours | 1.5h | 12.7h | 50.8h | 489.4h |
| Interactive sessions | 0 | 4 | 17 | 280 |
| Worker sessions | 38 | 289 | 340 | 2,295 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 90 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

| Model | Requests | Input | Output | Cache read | API Cost | Cache savings | Model savings |

_366.3M total tokens processed. 88.8% cache hit rate._

_$2,751.59 total saved ($2,051.93 caching + $699.66 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~88.8% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
