## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 0.1h | 3.4h | 6.3h | 6.3h |
| AI worker hours | 1.4h | 6.5h | 13.1h | 13.1h |
| AI concurrency hours | 1.8h | 10.8h | 21.4h | 21.4h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 6 | 8 | 8 |
| Worker sessions | 10 | 84 | 173 | 173 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours measured from AI message timestamps (reading, thinking, typing between responses)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_618.5M total tokens processed. 92.9% cache hit rate._

_$6,399.29 total saved ($5,818.98 caching + $580.31 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~92.9% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
