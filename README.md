## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 0.0h | 4.7h | 8.6h | 121.4h |
| AI worker hours | 0.7h | 8.5h | 43.0h | 268.6h |
| AI concurrency hours | 0.7h | 17.1h | 59.8h | 527.4h |
| Interactive sessions | 1 | 16 | 28 | 302 |
| Worker sessions | 12 | 111 | 69 | 2,295 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 109 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_413.3M total tokens processed. 89% cache hit rate._

_$3,081.95 total saved ($2,301.70 caching + $780.25 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~89% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
