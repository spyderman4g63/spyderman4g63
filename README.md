## Work with AI

| Metric | Yesterday | Prior 7 Days | Prior 28 Days | Prior 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 24h | 160h | 563.3h | ~6638h* |
| Interactive human attention | 0.0h | 0.0h | 1.8h | 120.2h |
| Interactive AI generation | 0.0h | 0.0h | 2.8h | 160.2h |
| Worker-classified human attention | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h | 0.0h |
| Worker/headless AI generation | 1.2h | 17.0h | 64.1h | 383.0h |
| Additive observed work | 1.2h | 17.0h | 68.7h | 663.4h |
| Interactive sessions | 0 | 0 | 7 | 445 |
| Worker sessions | 30 | 462 | 1,640 | 5,868 |

_Screen time from screen-time-history:daily-observations; collection status: ok. *365-day estimate uses observed calendar coverage._

_Periods are completed local calendar days ending at midnight; today is excluded._

_Human attention is unioned wall-clock time, so overlapping sessions are not double-counted. AI generation is additive machine work across sessions; it is not wall-clock concurrency._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 161 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_856.0M total tokens processed. 91% cache hit rate._

_$4,069.98 total saved ($2,103.65 caching + $1,966.34 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~91% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
