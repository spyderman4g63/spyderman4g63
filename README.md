## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 2.8h | 8.3h | 10.4h | 10.4h |
| AI worker hours | 0.8h | 8.6h | 15.0h | 15.0h |
| AI concurrency hours | 5.7h | 23.3h | 34.7h | 34.7h |
| Interactive sessions | 3 | 17 | 21 | 21 |
| Worker sessions | 16 | 147 | 265 | 265 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours measured from AI message timestamps (reading, thinking, typing between responses)._

_1,247.6M total tokens processed. 92.4% cache hit rate._

_$11,567.36 total saved ($10,616.25 caching + $951.10 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~92.4% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
