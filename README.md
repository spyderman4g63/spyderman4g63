## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 1.4h | 7.9h | 9.5h | 9.5h |
| AI worker hours | 1.0h | 7.8h | 16.7h | 16.7h |
| AI concurrency hours | 3.1h | 21.3h | 33.3h | 33.3h |
| Interactive sessions | 2 | 9 | 16 | 16 |
| Worker sessions | 22 | 139 | 293 | 293 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours measured from AI message timestamps (reading, thinking, typing between responses)._

_1,122.9M total tokens processed. 92.5% cache hit rate._

_$11,045.29 total saved ($10,179.76 caching + $865.53 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~92.5% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
