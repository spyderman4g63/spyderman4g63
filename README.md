## Work with AI

| Metric | 24h | 7 Days | 28 Days | 365 Days |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Screen time (Mac) | 0h | 0h | 0h | ~0h* |
| User AI session hours | 0.0h | 2.6h | 7.4h | 119.2h |
| AI worker hours | 1.3h | 9.8h | 43.4h | 265.5h |
| AI concurrency hours | 1.3h | 15.1h | 59.0h | 521.0h |
| Interactive sessions | 1 | 13 | 29 | 299 |
| Worker sessions | 12 | 132 | 124 | 2,295 |

_Screen time from macOS display events, snapshotted daily. *365-day extrapolated (accumulating real data)._

_User AI session hours are attended interactive time measured from gaps between AI responses and the next user message; AI concurrency hours include attended time, AI generation, and background workers._

_AI session 365-day totals cover 107 days of local assistant session history (not extrapolated)._

## AI Model Usage (last 30 days)

_388.0M total tokens processed. 88.5% cache hit rate._

_$2,686.12 total saved ($1,882.26 caching + $803.86 model routing vs all-Opus)._

_Model savings are modest because ~88.5% of tokens are cache reads, where price differences between models are small._
